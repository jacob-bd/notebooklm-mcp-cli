## Active Ideas

### 🎯 Master README Notebook
**Status:** Proposed
**Goal:** Single queryable knowledge base for all 60+ repos
**Questions:**
- One giant notebook or themed clusters?
- Auto-sync when READMEs change?
- What metadata to include beyond README content?

### 🔬 Automated Research Pipeline  
**Status:** Proposed
**Goal:** Each repo seeds research questions, NotebookLM finds answers
**Questions:**
- What's the MYSTERY.md format?
- How often to run?
- Human approval workflow?

### 🧠 Three-Tier Memory Integration
**Status:** Proposed
**Goal:** Unified queries across SADB + Fact Table + NotebookLM
**Questions:**
- How to rank/weight results from each tier?
- How to present conflicting information?
- What triggers which tier?
